# heatmap-with-mybinder
trying to figure out how to use github in conjunction with mybinder.org so other people can
remotely run the software without having to install any software.  I can do that via Jupyter
notebooks (for R or Python).  Can I also just use an rmarkdown file?  If I am using R libraries from
Bioconductor that may complicate things since mybinder can use MRAN to use a snapshot of 
many R libraries, but that does not include those in Bioconductor I think.

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample_repos.html  can be used with rstudio and rstudio
runs rmarkdown. So try to base my stuff on the example given here for rstudio ...
