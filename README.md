# heatmap-with-mybinder
trying to figure out how to use github in conjunction with mybinder.org so other people can
remotely run the software without having to install any software.  I can do that via Jupyter
notebooks (for R or Python).  Can I also just use an rmarkdown file?  If I am using R libraries from
Bioconductor that may complicate things since mybinder can use MRAN to use a snapshot of 
many R libraries, but that does not include those in Bioconductor I think.

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample_repos.html  can be used with rstudio and rstudio
runs rmarkdown. So try to base my stuff on the example given here for rstudio ... they also have
an example with ipywidgets ... and other interactive methods.
